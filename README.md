## Description of the main page that we have created.

We have created a simple home portal suitable for the style of the other pages that maintains the essence of the aesthetics of the main website (https://www.sabiosguiasinterpretes.com/).

In this page we have incorporated the necessary components to navigate between the routes and their vr version.

## Third-party components we've used.

We have used FullWithGrid component to organize the page into sections.

## Own components that we have used.

Both the footer and the header are of our own invention. We have created the hub to navigate between the vr routes.
